## The Project

This project was built for a Mintbean Hackathon, and was voted winner by a decent margin! The goal was to make a simple Markdown editor in under 4 hours. I not only finished on time, but managed to include most of the bonus features in my app. The full project features the following: 

- Live Preview
- Simultanious scoll between input and output
- Download as PDF

## The Process

I started off working with just static HTML/JS/CSS, then quickly scrapped that for an Express app. After wireframing the project, I decided to scrap it again in favor of my favourite front-end framework, React. From the beginning I knew that I'd be using [98.css](https://jdan.github.io/98.css/) , which is just the best for emulating the aesthetics of Windows 98 in a browser. Most of the heavy lifting is handled by [Markdown-It](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it), but getting it all to work together inside of a React app took a good chunk of the 4 hour limit.
